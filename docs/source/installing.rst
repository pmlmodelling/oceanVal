Installation
============

You will need to use Conda to use oceanVal. The first step is to create a new environment::

   $ conda env create --name oceanval -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pmlmodelling/ecoval/main/oceanval.yml
   $ conda activate oceanval

Once you have done that, install the development version from GitHub::

   $ pip install git+https://github.com/pmlmodelling/oceanval.git
